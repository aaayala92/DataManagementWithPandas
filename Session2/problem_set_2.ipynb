        "1. Identify the data types (dtypes) of each column in the dataset.\n",
        "2. You may realize that such column names as [‘total_outbound’, ‘expiry_date’, ‘pallet_grossweight’, ‘pallet_height’, ‘units_per_pallet’] are wordy. Please rename them as [‘TO’, ‘PW’, ‘PH’, ‘N_units’] or use other names according to your preferences.\n",
        "3. How many na values by column are there in the dataset?\n",
        "4. Remove the rows with na values and confirm this by recounting the number of na values.\n",
        "5. Save the resulting DataFrame as an Excel file.\n",
        "6. Calculate the average pallet gross weight for the remaining SKUs.\n",

They may require consultation with the Pandas library documentation and possibly involve functionalities not directly covered in the course. Completing these questions will demonstrate a deeper understanding of data manipulation and engineering and may require creative problem-solving and independent research.\n",

        "3. Group the dataset by quartiles of pallet_grossweight and calculate the average unitprice and total number of units within each quartile.\n",
