    "### Machine Learning vs Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "- Machine Learning: designed to make accurate predictions. Called blackbox in that sense\n",
    "\n",
    "- Statistical Models: designed for inference about relationship variabels. Relationship between variables\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statistical Thinking Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Describe the problem (Does variable A affect variable B)\n",
    "2. Collect Data\n",
    "3. Visualize the data\n",
    "4. Look for outliers, EDA\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variability\n",
    "\n",
    "- Successive observation that do not produce exactly same results\n",
    "- We need a variability benchmark to decide if it makes a difference or not\n",
    "\n",
    "### Descriptive Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "- With a Sample we try to understand the population\n",
    "- The sample must representative\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "- Categorical :['Nominal','Ordinal','Binary']\n",
    "- Numerical: ['Continuous','Discrete']\n",
    "\n",
    "- Poisson Distribution is to predict a count, discrete.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to use Sample to learn from population\n",
    "\n",
    "- with 30 samples, that are representative, we can estimate the mean. True mean is miu, sample mean is Xbar. true variance is sigma, sample variance is s.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Summaries\n",
    "\n",
    "- range is also affected by outliers\n",
    "- median is not affected by outliers. it is 50% of the data\n",
    "- if mean and median are the same you have a clean normal distribution\n",
    "- InterQuartile range is not heavily inference by outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "### EDA\n",
    "\n",
    "- Visualize the data\n",
    "- Correlation Matrix\n",
    "- Measure statistics such as mean, median, std\n",
    "- Dimensionality reduction\n",
    "- K-means clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dimensionality of Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "- Univariate (One variable, histogram or boxplots for example)\n",
    "- Bivariate (two variables, scatterplot for example)\n",
    "- Multivariate (two or more, bubble chart for example)\n",
    "\n",
    "### EDA-Outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "- How can we detect outliers\n",
    "- One way is with the boxplot. [End of whiskers is calculates as Q1-1.5*IQR or Q3+1.5 IQR]\n",
    "- another way is with the normal distribution. Standarizing Z-score [with thi one we consider 98% more or less of the data]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rescaling Data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Normalization of the data (Min-Max scaling), rescales the data between 0 and 1\n",
    "- Standardizing: mean of zero and standard deviation of 1\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple and Multiple linear regression\n",
    "\n",
    "- OLS: Ordinary Least Squared Method.\n",
    "- there is always an error\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multi-Collinearity Issue\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make sure that the regression is stable enough that you cannot rely on it. It confuses the betas of the regression.\n",
    "- If it is perfectly correlated your model is unstable, betas could interchange if you run it again.\n",
    "- Drop correlated variables. What is highly correlated.\n",
    "- Correlation matrix is just to raise a flag.\n",
    "- you can use the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF), it should be less than 5 or 10. It tries to predict one variable using another one. This is for all the features\n",
    "\n",
    "### F Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fstats says what is the odd that all of this variables are equal to 0, if F is large it tells you that at least one of them is greater than 0.\n",
