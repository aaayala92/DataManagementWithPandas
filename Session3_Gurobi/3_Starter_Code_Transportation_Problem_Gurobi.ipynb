        "A boutique brewery has two warehouses from which it distributes beer to five carefully chosen bars. At the start of every week, each bar sends an order to the brewery’s head office for so many crates of beer, which is then dispatched from the appropriate warehouse to the bar. The brewery would like to have an interactive computer program which they can run week by week to tell them which warehouse should supply which bar so as to minimize the costs of the whole operation. For example, suppose that at the start of a given week the brewery has 1000 cases at warehouse A, and 4000 cases at warehouse B, and that the bars require 500, 900, 1800, 200, and 700 cases respectively. Which warehouse should supply which bar?"

The problem can only be formulated as a linear program if the cost of transportation from warehouse to pub is a linear function of the amounts of crates transported. Note that this is sometimes not the case. This may be due to factors such as economies of scale or fixed costs. For example, transporting 10 crates may not cost 10 times as much as transporting one crate, since it may be the case that one truck can accommodate 10 crates as easily as one. Usually in this situation there are fixed costs in operating a truck which implies that the costs go up in jumps (when an extra truck is required). In these situations, it is possible to model such a cost by using zero-one integer variables.\n",
